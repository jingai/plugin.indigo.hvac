* infer dehumidify/compressor/heat stage from temperature/setpoint differential
- show totals for each stage in HTML output in the summary section
* fetch (from what site?) and store outdoor temp on state changes
- plot the outdoor temps as well (separate graph?)
* need a way to summarize data over a range of dates (weekly, monthly, etc)
* use dygraphs instead of jscharts?
- stepPlot for compressor cycles/staging
* it's possible we can miss events if Indigo isn't running when the thermostat
  changes modes.  not sure how to best handle this besides querying the device
  directly in the tracking scripts.
