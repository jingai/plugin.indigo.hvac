* infer compressor/heat stage from temperature/setpoint differential
- show totals for each stage in HTML output in the summary section
* fetch (from what site?) and store outdoor temp on state changes
- plot the outdoor temps as well (separate graph?)
* sometimes see an Off command right after an On command
* need a way to summarize data over a range of dates (weekly, monthly, etc)
* use dygraphs instead of jscharts?
