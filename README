DESCRIPTION
===========
This Indigo Pro Web Server plugin will display the historical thermostat
usage for the Venstar T1X00 series of thermostats via some nice, easy-to-read
graphs in your web browser.

Currently, the plugin will show you three graphs:

1) Humidity.  On this graph, it also shows the heating and cooling cycles to
   make it easy to discern what caused the shifts in humidity.  Note that
   this graph requires the humidity module in your thermostat.  If you have
   a T1900, this comes standard.  With the T1800, it's an optional purchase.
   It is not available at all for the T1700.

2) Cooling.  Plots the actual temperature read at the thermostat versus the
   desired cooling set points.  Also shown on the top of this graph are
   the compressor cycles.

3) Heating.  Plots the actual temperature read at the thermostat versus the
   desired heating set points.  Also shown on the top of this graph are
   the compressor cycles.

Both the Heating and Cooling graphs are shown at the same scale to make it
easier to eyeball what went on for that day.

At the top of the page is displayed a text summary of totals, including the
number of minutes the A/C and heater ran, number of compressor/heater cycles,
number of minutes on the current filter, and read temperature and humidity
minimums, maximums, and averages.

At the bottom all of the raw data is shown in tabular form.

REQUIREMENTS
============
You must have installed the companion attachment scripts that track the
thermostat usage.  In addition, you must have enabled SQLite Logging in
Indigo, which means you need Indigo Pro.

Indigo Pro 4.x has been tested and it may or may not work with earlier or
later versions, but I provide no guarantee that it will.

LIMITATIONS
===========
Currently, only one thermostat is supported.

INSTALLATION
============
1) Copy the "hvac-plot" folder to:
/Library/Application Support/Perceptive Automation/Indigo 4/IndigoWebServer/Plugins

2) Restart the Indigo Server.
